        <span>Hi there! I am a software developer with a love for storytelling. </span>

        <span>
          This passion led me to my first degree in Scenic Design and eventually to the New York City television
          industry. I enjoyed the unique challenge of working in an art department, and assisting my coworkers was a
          privilege. Eventually I decided that my love for storytelling would translate well to creating exceptional
          user experiences on the web and returned to school to study Computer Science in 2021.
        </span>

        <span>
          I am currently looking for work and can not wait to help a team build something that improves the lives of
          others.
